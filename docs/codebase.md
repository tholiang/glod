## Motivation

Developers can only reckon with very large codebases through abstraction. The way I see myself setting up this abstraction, with an unfamiliar codebase, is by carefully reading through the code, forming an abstraction, then "throwing" away the effort I spent. Sometimes I remember key things I find interesting, but leave these in the back of my mind.

LLMs do not have this naturally. We must have a codified engineering process built into these SWE agents. This isn't really vectorization, I don't really see it as a language task, but a reasoning task at its core. Of course approachable through language, and therefore approachable by LLMs, but the processes external to the LLMs need not be language based (as they are with vector dbs).
